## About
The dataset comes from the Kaggle competition - Titanic - Learning from disaster. The aim is to use Machine Learning to predict who would survive the sinking titanic based off the provided information.
Two datasets are provided the train.csv and test.csv.
- train.csv uesed to train the model
- test.csv USed to verify the models accuracy

In this basic demonstration the accuracy of the model is arround 77% which could be improved but that would require cleaning the dataset and creating new training features.
